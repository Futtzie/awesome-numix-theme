# awesome-numix-theme

Simple [awesome-wm](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) color theme that is based on the [numix-gtk-theme](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-gtk-theme) from the Numixproject. It is supposed to make awesome-wm blend in perfectly with the numix-gtk-theme.


## install

Copy the `numix` folder into the default awesome-wm theme folder usually `/usr/share/awesome/themes/`. Replace 
`beautiful.init("/usr/share/awesome/themes/default/theme.lua")` 
with 
`beautiful.init("/usr/share/awesome/themes/numix/dark/theme.lua")` 
in your rc.lua file.
